From here on I will fill my gaps with these (List taken from Michael Jordan's recommended readings)

- [ ] Ferguson, T. (1996). "A Course in Large Sample Theory" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

- [ ] You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and a good starting place is:
Lehmann, E. (2004). "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" Springer.

- [ ] Those are all frequentist books. You should also read something Bayesian:
Gelman, A. et al. (2003). "Bayesian Data Analysis" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

- [ ] and you should start to read about Bayesian computation:
Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005). "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" Springer.

- [ ] On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:
Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001). "Probability and Random Processes" Oxford.

- [ ] At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:
Pollard, D. (2001). "A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability" Cambridge.

- [ ] The standard advanced textbook is Durrett, R. (2005). "Probability: Theory and Examples" Duxbury.

- [ ] Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is also important. At some point you should feel familiar with most of the material in
Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996). "Matrix Computations" Johns Hopkins.

- [ ] It's good to know some information theory. The classic is:
Cover, T. and Thomas, J. "Elements of Information Theory" Wiley.

- [ ] Finally, if you want to start to learn some more abstract math, you might want to start to learn some functional analysis (if you haven't already). Functional analysis is essentially linear algebra in infinite dimensions, and it's necessary for kernel methods, for nonparametric Bayesian methods, and for various other topics. Here's a book that I find very readable:Kreyszig, E. (1989). "Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications" Wiley.

Papers i will read, implement and summarize, possibly post on here in tex or medium posts. 

Fill in unknown and or weak concepts, Quantstart articles have very solid resourses https://www.quantstart.com/articles

I want to implement an AI trading bot, for me to do so i want to learn The main techniques of  Multivariate Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Resampling Techniques, Tree-Based Methods (including Random Forests), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), Kernal Methods and Neural Networks.
