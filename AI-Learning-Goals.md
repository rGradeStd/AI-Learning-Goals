## Take a little break to learn a lot of math and stats aswell as information theory

Currently I am reading Introduction to statistical learning, and Elements of statisitcal learning as well as - Think Stats, and Think Bayes [Allen B. Downey]

(not decided as of right now but might go through Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop and or Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective)

From here on I will do the following (List taken from Michael Jordan's recommended readings)

- [ ] Ferguson, T. (1996). "A Course in Large Sample Theory" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

- [ ] You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and a good starting place is:
Lehmann, E. (2004). "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" Springer.

- [ ] Those are all frequentist books. You should also read something Bayesian:
Gelman, A. et al. (2003). "Bayesian Data Analysis" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

- [ ] and you should start to read about Bayesian computation:
Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005). "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" Springer.

- [ ] On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:
Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001). "Probability and Random Processes" Oxford.

- [ ] At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:
Pollard, D. (2001). "A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability" Cambridge.

- [ ] The standard advanced textbook is Durrett, R. (2005). "Probability: Theory and Examples" Duxbury.

- [ ] Machine learning research also reposes on optimization theory. A good starting book on linear optimization that will prepare you for convex optimization:
Bertsimas, D. and Tsitsiklis, J. (1997). "Introduction to Linear Optimization" Athena.

- [ ] And then you can graduate to:
Boyd, S. and Vandenberghe, L. (2004). "Convex Optimization" Cambridge.

- [ ] Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is also important. At some point you should feel familiar with most of the material in
Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996). "Matrix Computations" Johns Hopkins.

- [ ] It's good to know some information theory. The classic is:
Cover, T. and Thomas, J. "Elements of Information Theory" Wiley.

- [ ] Finally, if you want to start to learn some more abstract math, you might want to start to learn some functional analysis (if you haven't already). Functional analysis is essentially linear algebra in infinite dimensions, and it's necessary for kernel methods, for nonparametric Bayesian methods, and for various other topics. Here's a book that I find very readable:Kreyszig, E. (1989). "Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications" Wiley.

## Great you should now roughly have a pretty good understanding of machine learning stuff. Choose something you find most fascinating and specialize. Keep reading tons of papers, attending conferences and working with your peers.

## Step x (trading resources, will be done throughout AI learning)
- [ ] Beginner's Guide to Quantitative Trading (Quantstart)
- [ ] How to Identify Algorithmic Trading Strategies (Quantstart)
- [ ] Successful Backtesting of Algorithmic Trading Strategies - Part I

Some of my potential projects include damaged photo restoration, ai stock trading system, machine learning to generate css, various robotics based AI (servo arm to play tic tac toe) and much more.

Papers i will read, implement and summarize, possibly post on here in tex or medium posts. 

Fill in unknown and or weak concepts, Quantstart articles have very solid resourses https://www.quantstart.com/articles

I want to implement an AI trading bot, for me to do so i want to learn The main techniques of  Multivariate Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Resampling Techniques, Tree-Based Methods (including Random Forests), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical), Kernal Methods and Neural Networks.
